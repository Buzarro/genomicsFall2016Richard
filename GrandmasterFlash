my brother's doing bad, stole my mother's TV, says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
all the children in the daytime, Dallas at night. Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors that ring my phone and scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double digit inflation, can't take take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon, King Kong, standing on my back. Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A midgrange migraine cancer membrane sometimes I think I'm going insane I swear I might hijack a plane!
